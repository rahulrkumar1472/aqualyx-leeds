## Thigh contour goals are often nuanced

Thigh-area goals vary from person to person. Some clients focus on inner-thigh contour, others on outer-thigh shape. Because area size and tissue profile differ, planning should be highly individual.

At **Aqualyx Leeds**, thigh treatment is approached with realistic, staged planning where needed.

## Consultation checklist for thigh treatment

- Clarify your main contour concern (inner, outer, or both)
- Discuss what is realistically achievable
- Understand likely session spacing
- Ask how progress will be assessed
- Review aftercare priorities and support channels

A practical checklist helps prevent rushed decisions.

## Typical timeline framework

| Time range | Typical focus |
| --- | --- |
| Consultation week | Suitability and area-specific planning |
| Week 1 | Early aftercare and settling |
| Weeks 2-6 | Gradual contour response for many clients |
| Review | Plan adjustment and session decisions |

Timeline is always individual and results vary.

## Cost and session planning

Thigh areas can require different ml planning compared with smaller areas. This is why per-ml pricing is more transparent than one fixed package for everyone.

Final cost is confirmed after consultation and treatment planning.
