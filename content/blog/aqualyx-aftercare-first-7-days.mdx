## Why the first 7 days matter

Aftercare is not just an add-on. It is part of the treatment pathway and helps protect comfort, consistency, and realistic expectations.

At **Aqualyx Leeds**, first-week guidance is designed to reduce confusion and keep communication clear if anything feels off.

## First-week checklist

| Day range | Priority | Practical action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day 0-1 | Follow immediate instructions | Stick closely to clinic guidance for your area |
| Day 2-3 | Routine consistency | Keep hydration, avoid unnecessary area stress |
| Day 4-5 | Observation | Track how the area feels and note changes calmly |
| Day 6-7 | Review readiness | Prepare questions for follow-up or next appointment |

Keep it simple. Consistent basics usually beat constant self-adjustments.

## What to avoid in the first week

Common mistakes include:

- Comparing yourself to someone else’s timeline online
- Ignoring the specific guidance given for your treated area
- Making treatment decisions too quickly before review
- Delaying contact when symptoms feel abnormal

Use your clinic as the primary source for post-treatment decisions.

## What "normal variation" can look like

People can respond differently in early recovery. That variation does not automatically mean good or bad final outcome. This is why review points are built into consultation-led planning.

If you are unsure whether something is expected, ask directly rather than waiting.

## When to contact a clinician sooner

Speak to your clinic promptly if symptoms are:

- Unexpectedly severe
- Persistent beyond guidance
- Getting worse instead of settling
- Causing concern that affects normal routine

Online articles cannot replace personalised clinical review.

## Communication plan for better outcomes

A practical communication plan:

- Save the clinic phone and WhatsApp contacts before treatment day.
- Keep a short note of symptoms and dates.
- Share concise updates if asked by your practitioner.
- Attend the advised follow-up window.

This makes support faster and more accurate.
