## Why people ask this question

Most clients want a realistic budget and timeline before booking. Knowing typical ml ranges by area helps with early planning.

## Typical guide ranges used in consultation

| Area | Typical ml range |
| --- | --- |
| Double chin | 2-6 ml |
| Lower abdomen | 6-16 ml |
| Love handles | 6-12 ml |
| Upper arms | 4-10 ml |
| Thighs | 8-20 ml |

These are educational ranges only, not a diagnosis or prescription.

## Why final ml can change

Final dosing may differ due to:

- Area size and contour shape
- Tissue characteristics at assessment
- Session strategy and response over time
- Clinical safety considerations

## Session planning logic

A safe plan may involve:

- Conservative starting range
- Follow-up review before escalation
- Clear documentation of response

This staged approach helps align safety and realistic outcomes.

## Cost planning with ml ranges

If you know likely ranges, you can build an approximate budget using per-ml pricing. Then confirm a precise quote in consultation.
