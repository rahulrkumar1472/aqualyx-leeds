## Why the double chin area is treated differently

The submental area is small but visible, so planning needs precision. Aqlauyx Leeds assesses the area carefully during consultation and sets realistic targets based on anatomy, baseline profile, and safety checks.

## Typical dosage guide (not a guarantee)

| Area | Typical discussion range | Final decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Double chin | 2-6 ml | Confirmed only after consultation |

Online examples often miss important context. Final planning depends on your individual assessment.

## Final note

A double chin plan works best when expectations are realistic and dosing is consultation-led. Results vary, and the safest route is always the one confirmed in person.
