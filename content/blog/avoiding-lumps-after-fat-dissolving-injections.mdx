## Start with the right expectation

After fat dissolving treatment, people sometimes worry about temporary unevenness or texture changes during early recovery. The safest approach is to follow your clinic guidance and avoid improvising based on online advice.

At **Aqualyx Leeds**, aftercare is treated as part of the treatment plan, not an optional extra.

## Habits that usually support smoother recovery

- Follow your post-treatment instructions exactly
- Keep hydration and routine consistent
- Avoid unnecessary pressure or manipulation of treated areas
- Track symptoms calmly rather than checking constantly
- Use scheduled review points for decision-making

Consistency usually outperforms reactive changes.

## Practical monitoring table

| Time window | What to do | When to escalate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day 0-2 | Follow immediate aftercare, keep notes | If symptoms are severe or unexpected |
| Day 3-7 | Stay consistent with guidance | If concerns persist or worsen |
| Week 2 onward | Review gradual progression | If response feels outside your plan |

When in doubt, contact the clinic rather than waiting too long.

## What to avoid

Avoid these common mistakes:

- Trying multiple contradictory tips from social media
- Assuming your timeline must match someone else’s
- Ignoring clinician advice because progress feels slow
- Delaying contact when symptoms are concerning

Safe aftercare is a structured process.
