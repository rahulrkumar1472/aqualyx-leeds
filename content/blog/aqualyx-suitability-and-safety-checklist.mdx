## Why a checklist helps

A checklist helps you ask better questions and make a safer decision. It also reduces the chance of booking treatment without understanding suitability.

## Pre-consultation checklist

- Clarify your main target area
- List your current medications
- Note relevant medical history
- Record previous aesthetic/body treatments
- Prepare questions about timeline and cost

## Suitability topics to discuss

| Topic | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Treatment goal | Aligns plan with realistic outcomes |
| Area assessment | Confirms whether localised fat is suitable |
| Contraindications | Identifies whether treatment should be deferred |
| Session planning | Sets realistic pace and review points |

## Informed consent checklist

Before treatment, you should understand:

- What treatment is being proposed and why
- What outcomes are realistic for your baseline
- What side effects or responses may occur
- What aftercare is required
- When to contact the clinic

If anything feels unclear, pause and ask more questions.

## Red flags to avoid

- Guaranteed outcomes
- Pressure to proceed without proper screening
- No written aftercare guidance
- No clear review plan

## Pricing and transparency checks

Ask for clarity on:

- Price per ml
- Typical ml estimate for your area
- How total cost is confirmed
