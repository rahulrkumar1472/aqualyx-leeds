keyTakeaways:
  - "Aqualyx and fat freezing solve different contour scenarios."
  - "Your area and baseline determine which pathway is more suitable."
  - "Consultation should include safety checks and realistic timeline discussion."
faqs:
  - question: "Is fat freezing always better for the stomach?"
    answer: "Not always. Suitability depends on fat type, area profile, and treatment goals."
  - question: "Can I combine pathways?"
    answer: "Combination plans may be discussed in some cases, but only after clinician assessment."

## The short answer

Neither option is universally “better.” The best route depends on your target area, baseline profile, treatment tolerance, and what level of change is realistic.

## How each pathway works

| Feature | Aqualyx | Fat Freezing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Modality | Injection-based pathway | Cooling applicator pathway |
| Common use | Localised contouring goals | Pinchable fat in selected zones |
| Planning style | Area-led dosage and review | Package-led sessions |
| Progress style | Gradual over weeks | Gradual over weeks |

Both require consultation and no guarantees should be made.

## Decision factors to review in consultation

- Where is the fat pocket and how is it distributed?
- Is the target tissue suitable for injections, cooling, or both?
- Are you prepared for staged sessions and follow-up?
- What is a realistic timeline?

## Comfort and practicality

Some clients prefer non-injection pathways. Others prefer injection-led plans for specific areas. Comfort preference matters, but suitability comes first.

## Cost comparison notes

- Aqualyx is usually discussed with per-ml pricing
- Fat freezing is usually discussed with package pricing

Review both:

- [Fat dissolving pricing](/pricing/fat-dissolving)
- [Fat freezing packages](/pricing/fat-freezing)

## When “better” means safer

The better option is the one that:

- Passes suitability checks
- Matches your anatomical profile
- Provides a realistic plan
- Includes clear aftercare and review

## Final note

Choose the pathway that fits your profile, not the one with louder marketing. Informed consultation remains the best decision tool.
