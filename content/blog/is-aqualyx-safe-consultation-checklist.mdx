## Safety is a process, not a slogan

When people ask "is Aqualyx safe?" the most accurate answer is: safety depends on proper assessment, suitability, and planning. A safe pathway includes screening, consent, realistic expectations, and structured aftercare.

At **Aqualyx Leeds**, consultation is used to decide whether treatment is appropriate before any plan is confirmed.

## Consultation safety checklist

Use this checklist during your consultation:

- Was my medical background discussed clearly?
- Were contraindications and reasons to delay explained?
- Did we discuss realistic outcomes, not guarantees?
- Was aftercare explained in practical steps?
- Do I understand when to contact the clinic after treatment?

If any of these are unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.

## What strong consultation communication looks like

| Good sign | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Clear explanation of suitability and limits | Reduces unrealistic expectations |
| Transparent pricing logic | Prevents rushed financial decisions |
| Structured timeline guidance | Helps plan review and follow-up |
| Written or verbal aftercare guidance | Supports safer recovery |

A premium clinic should be straightforward, not vague.

## Who may need extra caution

Some clients may need deferred treatment or alternative advice based on screening findings. This is a safety-positive decision, not a failure.

If your clinician advises delay, that should be respected and reviewed properly.

## Questions worth asking before booking treatment

- What makes me a suitable or unsuitable candidate?
- What is a realistic timeline for my area?
- How many sessions may be discussed for my profile?
- What are the key side effects to monitor?
- How should I contact the clinic if concerns arise?

These questions improve decision quality and reduce anxiety later.

## Red flags to avoid

Be careful if you hear:

- Guaranteed outcomes
- One-size-fits-all session promises
- Dismissal of contraindication questions
- Pressure to decide immediately

Safe care is measured, transparent, and consultation-led.
