## The phrase people see everywhere

"Results vary" appears on most treatment pages, but it is often not explained clearly. In practical terms, it means each person responds differently based on area profile, baseline factors, and treatment plan.

## Main factors that influence response

- Area anatomy and tissue profile
- Session design and spacing
- Adherence to aftercare guidance
- Realism of initial goals

## Expectation table

| Scenario | Common expectation | Better expectation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First session | Immediate dramatic change | Gradual progression over review windows |
| Cost planning | One fixed number online | Range guidance, then final quote in consultation |
| Timeline | Same for everyone | Individual timeline based on assessment |

## Why consultation changes outcomes

Consultation reduces mismatch between goals and realistic treatment planning. You can ask direct questions, review options, and decide with better clarity.

## Questions worth asking

- What is realistic for my specific area?
- What timeline is typical in my case?
- How will we review progress?
- What would make you adjust the plan?

## Mid CTA

For clear expectations tailored to your area, use [Book Free Consultation](/book) and review [Aqualyx pricing](/pricing/aqualyx) before your appointment.

## Final takeaway

Results vary is not a warning to ignore. It is a practical reminder to plan treatment individually and avoid generic promises.
