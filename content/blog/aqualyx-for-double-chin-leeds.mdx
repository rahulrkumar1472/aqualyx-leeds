## Why people focus on the chin area first

The chin and jawline are highly visible. Even subtle contour changes can feel meaningful. That is why many first-time clients ask about this area during consultation.

A chin-focused treatment plan should consider:

- Fat pocket distribution under the chin
- Skin quality and elasticity
- Your baseline profile from front and side view

## Consultation points for double-chin planning

At consultation, discussion often includes:

- Area suitability and likely treatment path
- Dosing range estimate for the submental area
- Session spacing and review windows
- What “normal” recovery may look like

The right plan is usually measured and staged, not rushed.

## Typical pathway overview

| Phase | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| Consultation | Suitability, goals, baseline photos/notes |
| Initial session | Area mapping and treatment delivery |
| Follow-up window | Recovery monitoring and early contour changes |
| Review | Decide whether further sessions are advised |

## Who may be suitable

Common suitability themes:

- Adults near a stable weight with localised submental fat
- People seeking contouring rather than full-body weight change
- People ready to follow aftercare guidance

Who may need alternative advice:

- People looking for rapid full-face transformation
- People with contraindications identified at consultation

## Aftercare priorities for this area

- Follow clinic aftercare instructions exactly
- Keep follow-up communication open
- Report unexpected symptoms promptly

Aftercare does not “guarantee” a result, but it supports safer planning and consistent review.

## Cost context for double-chin planning

Cost is linked to dosing and number of sessions discussed for your baseline.

## Expectations and mindset

A realistic goal is progressive contour improvement over a planned timeline. Most people benefit from viewing this as a process, not a single event.
