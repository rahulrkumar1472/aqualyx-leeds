## Why Aqualyx Leeds uses consultation-first planning

Aqualyx is best approached as a structured pathway, not a quick one-size-fits-all appointment. At Aqualyx Leeds, the first step is a consultation where your goals, medical context, and treatment area are reviewed before any treatment decision is made.

This approach helps set realistic expectations. Some people expect rapid changes after one visit, while others need staged planning over multiple review windows. A consultation gives you a clearer and safer route forward.

## What is reviewed in consultation

A typical consultation usually covers:

- Your primary concern area (for example chin, lower stomach, or love handles)
- Suitability and contraindication screening
- Typical dosage range guidance for the area
- Expected timeline and review checkpoints
- Aftercare priorities and warning signs
- Quote framework and booking options

The aim is clarity. You should leave consultation knowing what may help, what may not, and what the next step should be.

## Planning table: what gets decided when

| Stage | What is confirmed | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial consultation | Suitability, target area, broad plan | Prevents rushed treatment decisions |
| Dose planning | Typical ml range guidance | Supports realistic cost expectations |
| Treatment phase | Session pathway and aftercare | Keeps plan structured and safer |
| Review checkpoint | Progress and next-step decision | Avoids over- or under-treating |

## Dosage and cost conversations

Online content often creates confusion about dosage. In practice, dosage is estimated by area, baseline profile, and treatment plan. That is why pricing is discussed as guidance first, then confirmed in person.

## What "results vary" means in practice

"Results vary" is not a vague disclaimer. It reflects real factors:

- Area profile and tissue characteristics
- Session spacing and adherence to aftercare
- Lifestyle context and realistic treatment goals
- Whether staged sessions are advised

At Aqualyx Leeds, this is discussed upfront so there are no unrealistic promises.

## Questions to ask at your first appointment

Bring these questions with you:

- What result is realistic for my area and timeline?
- What dosage range is usually discussed for this area?
- How many review checkpoints are likely?
- What signs should prompt me to contact the clinic?
- What are my alternatives if this route is unsuitable?
