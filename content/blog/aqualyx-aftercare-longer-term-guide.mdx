## Aftercare is not just for week one

Many people focus on the first few days, then stop paying attention. In reality, longer-term aftercare and review attendance can influence how well your treatment pathway is managed.

## Longer-term checklist

- Follow all guidance provided in consultation
- Keep review appointments as advised
- Note meaningful changes between checkpoints
- Ask questions early rather than waiting

## Review timeline table

| Window | Priority |
| --- | --- |
| Week 1-2 | Settle into aftercare routine |
| Week 3-4 | Track progress and response notes |
| Week 5-8 | Review with clinic and plan next steps |

## When to contact the clinic

- Symptoms feel unusual or prolonged
- You are unsure whether response is expected
- You need clarification before booking the next step
