## Why arm treatment needs careful planning

Arm contour concerns can vary widely. Some clients are suitable for a treatment plan, while others may need different advice. This is why consultation should always come before commitment.

At **Aqualyx Leeds**, arm-area decisions are based on suitability, safety, and realistic change over time.

## What consultation usually covers

- Area mapping and baseline assessment
- Discussion of realistic contour goals
- Session strategy and spacing
- Aftercare and review expectations
- Per-ml pricing logic

A clear plan should explain both possibilities and limitations.

## Typical planning timeline

| Stage | What is usually discussed |
| --- | --- |
| Consultation | Suitability, area definition, and realistic target |
| Early phase | Initial aftercare and response monitoring |
| Mid phase | Gradual contour change assessment |
| Review | Decision on whether more sessions are appropriate |

Results vary by person and cannot be guaranteed.

## Questions worth asking

- Is my arm-area profile suitable for treatment?
- What should I realistically expect in the first 4-8 weeks?
- How will we measure progress?
- What should trigger a follow-up call sooner?

Strong questions produce better treatment decisions.
