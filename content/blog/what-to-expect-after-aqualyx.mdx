## Why aftercare matters

Aftercare is not an optional extra. It is part of the treatment pathway and helps you understand what is expected versus what needs review.

## First 7 days: practical focus

The first week is usually about:

- Following the specific aftercare instructions given at your appointment
- Monitoring how the treated area responds
- Keeping communication open with your clinic

Avoid comparing your day-by-day experience too closely with other people. Individual response differs.

## Recovery timeline snapshot

| Time window | Typical focus |
| --- | --- |
| Day 0-2 | Follow instructions and observe the area |
| Day 3-7 | Continue aftercare and monitor progress |
| Weeks 2-4 | Gradual contour response may begin |
| Review stage | Discuss progress and next steps |

## What is often discussed as “normal”

Your clinician will explain what may be expected for your area and baseline. Because treatment plans vary, the safest reference is always your own aftercare advice.

## When to escalate promptly

Contact your clinic if:

- Symptoms are prolonged beyond expected guidance
- Symptoms are worsening rather than settling
- You are unsure whether your response is typical

If urgent medical symptoms occur, seek appropriate urgent care.

## Habits that support follow-up quality

- Keep your follow-up appointment
- Keep notes/photos for your own progress tracking
- Ask direct questions at review

## Final note

Aftercare is about informed monitoring and safe progression, not chasing instant change. Results vary, and good communication with your clinic is central to a safer experience.
