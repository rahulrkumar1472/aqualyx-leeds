## Why clinic selection matters

Treatment outcomes are influenced by assessment quality, communication, and follow-up care. A clinic that explains limits, not just benefits, usually offers a safer and clearer customer experience.

## Clinic checklist table

| --- | --- |
| Consultation-first process | Supports safer treatment decisions |
| Clear pricing model | Reduces surprises and confusion |

## Questions worth asking
