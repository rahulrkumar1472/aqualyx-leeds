## What Aqualyx is, in plain English

Aqualyx is an injectable treatment pathway used to target localised stubborn fat areas. It is not designed for overall weight reduction, and it is not a substitute for diet, activity, or medical weight-management care.

At **Aqualyx Leeds**, treatment starts with consultation, not injections. The aim is to assess whether treatment is suitable, which areas are realistic to target, and what timeline may be appropriate for your baseline.

## Common treatment goals discussed in Leeds

People usually ask about:

- Chin and jawline contouring
- Lower abdomen pockets
- Love handles/flanks
- Upper arms
- Inner or outer thighs

The best target area depends on skin quality, fat distribution, treatment history, and your tolerance for staged sessions.

## Consultation pathway at Aqualyx Leeds

A consultation usually covers:

- Medical/safety screening and contraindication review
- Area mapping and realistic outcome discussion
- Typical ml estimate by area
- Session spacing and aftercare
- Cost estimate and next-step decision

You should leave consultation understanding both potential benefits and limits. If treatment is not suitable, alternatives may be discussed.

## Typical timeline (results vary)

| Stage | What is usually discussed |
| --- | --- |
| Consultation week | Suitability, area plan, expected timeline |
| Week 1 | Early response, aftercare focus |
| Weeks 2-4 | Gradual visible contour changes for some clients |
| Weeks 4-8 | Review and decision on further sessions |

Some people respond faster than others. The right expectation is **progress over time**, not instant transformation.

## Cost guide and price-per-ml logic

Aqualyx Leeds uses a per-ml structure. This supports tailored planning by area instead of one fixed price for everyone.

Key point: a larger area usually needs more ml and may require staged sessions.
