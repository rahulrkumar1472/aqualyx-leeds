## Why comparisons can be confusing

Most online comparisons focus on headlines rather than suitability. In practice, the better question is: "Which approach fits my area and goals after assessment?"

## Side-by-side overview

| Pathway | Typical fit | Planning style |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aqualyx | Localised stubborn pockets | Per-ml and staged review |
| Fat freezing | Suitable pinchable fat areas | Package and applicator-based |
| Cavitation | Non-invasive session preference | Session package pathway |

## What to discuss before deciding

- Your top-priority area and goal
- Whether you prefer injection or non-invasive route
- Timeline expectations and review checkpoints
- Budget range and pricing transparency
