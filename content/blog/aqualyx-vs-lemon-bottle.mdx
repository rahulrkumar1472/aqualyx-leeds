## Why this comparison matters

Most people do not need more information overload. They need a clear way to compare options safely.

When people search for **Aqualyx vs Lemon Bottle**, they usually want to know:

- Which is likely to suit their target area
- What timeline to expect
- How pricing works
- What risks or limitations to consider

The safest approach is to compare clinic process quality, not just product names.

## Compare the pathway, not just the product

| Comparison point | Aqualyx pathway | Lemon Bottle pathway |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Consultation | Required before planning | Required before planning |
| Use case | Localised stubborn fat areas | Supporting option for localised areas |
| Planning | Area-led dosing and review plan | Area-led dosing and review plan |
| Outcome model | Gradual, staged response | Gradual, staged response |

Both routes should include contraindication checks and realistic expectation setting.

## Questions to ask in consultation

Use these high-value questions:

- Is my target area suitable for this pathway?
- What ml range is typical for my area?
- How many sessions might be discussed?
- What are likely signs of normal recovery?
- When should I call if symptoms persist?

A good clinic gives direct answers and avoids guarantees.

## Suitability factors that matter

Common factors discussed include:

- Fat pattern and pinchability in target area
- Skin quality and baseline contour
- Medical and medication history
- Previous treatment history
- Ability to follow aftercare and reviews

These factors often matter more than the brand name itself.
